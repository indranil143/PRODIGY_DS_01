# PRODIGY_DS_01

Welcome,
In this task for my Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world_population_dataset (2001-2022), with a focus on visualization to represent data distribution.

# Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

# EDA Process
- Data Cleaning: Managed missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Visualization: Created bar and stacked charts to clearly represent the distribution of key variables, providing crucial insights through visual interpretation.

# Conclusion
Visualizations played a central role in uncovering patterns and trends, making this EDA a strong foundation for further exploration and data modeling.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
